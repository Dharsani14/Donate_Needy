# Food waste management system
<p>  The basic concept of this project  Food Waste Management is to collect theexcess/leftover food from donors such as hotels, restaurants, marriage halls, etc and distribute to  the  needy people .</p>
<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2> 
<ul>
 <li>Frontend : HTML, CSS,  JavaScript</li>
 <li>Backend  : php</li>
 <li>webserver: xampp server</li>
 <li>Database: MySQL </li>
</ul>

 <h2>The system has three modules. </h2>
    <ul><li>User</li>
    <li>Admin</li>
    <li>Delivery</li></ul>
   <br>
    <p>People who want to contribute their extra or leftover food to prevent food waste can do so using the User module.The User module is in charge of accepting food donations from users, such as wedding venues, restaurants, or individuals, who have extra food.Users are given the option to sign up, log in, and donate food through the module. Users can choose the kind and quantity of food they want to contribute, and the system will find the nearby charities or individuals in need of that food.Users can also view their donations using the module.The Admin module receives the data from the User module for processing.

   <p>
      The Administrator module is for trusts, NGOs, and charities that are registered on the platform. The Admin module is designed for system administrators who manage the food distribution process. The Admin module receives information about the food donation from the User module and lists it for NGOs and charities to choose from.Admins can view and manage the list of donations received, including the type and quantity of food donated. NGOs and charities can select the food donation they need from the Admin module and request a pickup to the Delivery module.The Admin module is responsible for tracking the requests and keeping track of which organizations have taken which donations
   </p><br>
    <p>Trusts, NGOs, and charities that have registered on the site can use the Administrator module. System administrators that oversee the food distribution process should use the Admin module. Information regarding the food contribution is obtained from the User module and listed for NGOs and charities to choose from by the Admin module.The list of donations received, including the kind and quantity of food supplied, is available for admins to examine and administer. NGOs and charitable organizations can choose the food contribution they require from the Admin module and submit a pickup request to the Delivery module.The Admin module is in charge of monitoring the requests and recording which charities have received which donations.
    </p><br>
    <p>The Food Waste Management System's overall goal is to effectively manage surplus food and make sure that it is given to those in need. Food donations are accepted by the User module, listed by the Admin module for NGOs and charities to choose from, then picked up and dropped off by the Delivery Person module. The community gains from this method since it decreases food waste and aids people in need.
